                        A subspecies of the axis deer (Axis axis), the Sri Lankan axis deer (Axis axis ceylonensis), sometimes known as the Ceylon spotted deer, is unique to Sri Lanka. In Sri Lanka, there is no usage of the name Chital. There is disagreement over its validity; some contend that the axis deer is monotypic, meaning it lacks subspecies.

                        The panda bear, which originated in China, is distinguished by its spherical body and black-and-white coat. Often referred to as the "giant panda," it is not the same as the red panda. Adults are 1.2–1.9 meters in length and weigh 100–115 kilograms. Males are larger than females by 10–20%. With black markings around the eyes, ears, legs, and shoulders, their fur is primarily white. Pandas can grasp bamboo with their forepaws, which resemble thumbs, in order to consume it. To suit their dietary needs, they grew greater temporal fossa and molars.

                        Great apes called orangutans are indigenous to the rainforests of Malaysia and Indonesia. They used to be widespread throughout Southeast Asia and South China, but they are now restricted to areas of Borneo and Sumatra. Initially thought to be a single species, orangutans are classified as members of the genus Pongo. They were split into two species as of 1996: the Sumatran orangutan and the Bornean orangutan. In 2017, a third species—the Tapanuli orangutan was positively identified. The subfamily Ponginae, from which orangutans are the sole extant species, underwent a genetic divergence from other hominids between 19.3 and 15.7 million years ago.

                        The cheetah is a large cat and the fastest land animal. It has a tawny to creamy white or pale buff fur that is marked with evenly spaced, solid black spots. The head is small and rounded, with a short snout and black tear-like facial streaks. It reaches 67–94 cm at the shoulder, and the head-and-body length is between 1.1 and 1.5 m. Adults weigh between 21 and 72 kg. The cheetah is capable of running at 93 to 104 km/h it has evolved specialized adaptations for speed, including a light build, long thin legs, and a long tail.

                        Native to Africa and India, the lion is a big member of the Panthera genus of cats. Its features include round ears, a short, rounded head, a broad, muscular torso, and a hairy tuft at the end of its tail. It is sexually dimorphic; mature male lions have a noticeable mane and are larger than females. It is a gregarious animal that forms prides. A few adult males, related females, and cubs make up a lion's pride. Usually hunting in packs, female lions mostly target huge ungulates for their prey. As an apex and keystone predator, lions usually do not actively seek out and prey on humans, yet some have been known to hunt humans and scavenge when circumstances arise.

                        As a member of the genus Panthera, the tiger is the biggest species of cat currently in existence. Its black stripes on orange fur with a white underside are what most identify it. Being an apex predator, it mostly feeds on ungulates like wild boar and deer. Large, continuous tracts of habitat are necessary to support this territorial, solitary, but gregarious predator's needs for prey and raising young. After spending around two years with their mother, tigers become independent and leave the mother's home area to create their own.

                        African horses known as zebras have characteristic coats with black and white stripes. The Grévy's zebra, the plains zebra, and the black zebra are the three extant species. As the sole surviving members of the family Equidae, zebras, horses, and asses are all members of the same genus, Equus. Each individual has a particular pattern of zebra stripes. The purpose of these stripes has been the subject of several theories, the majority of which point to their ability to keep biting flies away. Savannahs, grasslands, forests, shrublands, and hilly regions are just a few of the habitats that zebras call home throughout eastern and southern Africa.

                        A huge hoofed mammal from Africa, the giraffe is a member of the genus Giraffa. It is the biggest ruminant and tallest terrestrial animal that currently exists. Giraffa camelopardalis, the species commonly known as giraffes, is divided into nine subspecies. Due to recent discoveries regarding their nuclear and mitochondrial DNA as well as morphological assessments, scientists have suggested splitting them into as many as eight surviving species. Based on the fossil record, seven additional extinct species of Giraffa are identified.

                        Often referred to as the koala bear, the koala is an arboreal marsupial native to Australia. It is the only surviving member of the wombat-related Phascolarctidae family. Koalas are huge, fluffy animals with dark noses that are found throughout the eastern and southern shores of Australia, especially in Queensland, New South Wales, Victoria, and South Australia. Their fur ranges from silver gray to chocolate brown, and they weigh between 4 and 15 kg. They are 60 to 85 cm in length. It is debatable whether or not northern koalas, which are smaller and lighter than their southern counterparts, belong to different subspecies.

                        Originally from the continent of Asia, the Indian elephant is a recognized subspecies of the Asian elephant. Its head is the highest point on the animal, and its back is convex, making it smaller than its African relatives. Males exhibit substantial sexual dimorphism, growing to a shoulder height of around 3.2 m and weighing 5,400 kg, while females reach approximately 2.54 m and 4,160 kg. Their features include a longer trunk, smooth grey skin, four huge legs, a long tail, a concave forehead, large ears folded laterally, and a broader skull.n

They hold objects with their powerful, dexterous toes just like hands. In deep rainforests, their voices can be heard shrieking, squawking, and growing louder.
