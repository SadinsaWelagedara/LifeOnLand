            <h2 class="name">INDUSTRIAL ACTIVITIES</h2>
            <div class="details">Pollution of the environment is mostly caused by industrial activity, 
                especially when it comes to emissions from industries. A variety of hazardous gasses and compounds are released 
                into the air, water, and land by these operations. The environment and human health are both severely harmed by such emissions.

        <h2 class="name">AGRICULTURAL PRACTICES</h2>
        <div class="details">Through a variety of methods, agricultural activities have a significant impact on environmental contamination. 
            The overuse of pesticides and fertilizers pollutes water sources by causing runoff that contains substances that harm both human 
            health and aquatic life. The emission of ammonia, which is an essential component of agriculture, is a result of raising livestock,
            which pollutes the air and affects human respiratory health and air quality. Particulate matter is one 
            kind of air pollution caused by livestock production.</div>

            <h2 class="name">WASTE DISPOSAL</h2>
            <div class="details">Ineffective waste management contributes significantly to environmental pollution in several ways.
                Waste that is not properly handled contaminates soil, causes land contamination, and puts both people and animals in danger.
                Waste disposal also pollutes water when it gets into bodies of water, harming aquatic life and ecosystems as well as making 
                freshwater unfit for human consumption.</div>

        <h2 class="name">MINING ACTIVITIES</h2>
        <div class="details">Several processes used by mining operations have an enormous negative influence on the environment.
             These activities pose health concerns to the general population and increase environmental deterioration by contaminating 
             the land, water, and air. Toxic materials including heavy metals and chemicals are discharged into the environment during 
             the mining and processing of ores, resulting in soil erosion, water pollution, and ecological disruption.</div>
